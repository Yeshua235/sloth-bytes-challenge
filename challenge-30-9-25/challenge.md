# Keyword Cipher


## A Keyword Cipher replaces each letter of a message with a letter from a shifted alphabet built using a keyword.

1. Start with the keyword.

2. Add the remaining letters of the alphabet (A–Z) in order, skipping any that already appeared in the keyword.

    - Example keyword: "KEYWORD"

    - Cipher alphabet: KEYWORDABCFGHIJLMNPQSTUVXZ

3. Encrypt by replacing each letter in the message with the letter at the same position in the cipher alphabet.

    - Plain alphabet: ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ

    - Cipher alphabet: KEYWORDABCFGHIJLMNPQSTUVXZ
