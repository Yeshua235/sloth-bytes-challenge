# Trace the Path of the Word

## Given a grid of letters, check if a word can be traced by moving up, down, left, or right from one letter to the next.

- **Write a function that returns the path as a list of [row, col] positions, or "Not present" if the word is not found/can’t be created.**

### Notes

- *The target word will never be longer than the grid of letters.*

- *Target word and the letters grid will be in upper case.*
