# Sloth Bytes Challenge

Welcome to the Sloth Bytes Challenge repository! This repository contains the solution attempts to the weekly programming challenge by ```Sloth Bytes``` aimed at improving coding  and problem solving skills.


## Repository Structure

Each solution attempts is contained within a folder which is named "challenge" followed by the date when the challenge was received. For instance, the folder "challenge-9-9-25/", contains the solution attempt for the challenge received on 9th of September, 2025.

Within the folder for each challenge is a "challenge.md" file which contains the details for that particular challenge, the python file containing the solution to that challenge and a tests.py file containing the tests.
